Q: How can I check current road conditions in  ?
A: The best way to check real-time road conditions, including construction, incidents, and winter weather, is to use the MoDOT Traveler Information Map available on the official MoDOT website. You can also call our toll-free number at 888-ASK-MODOT for automated road condition reports.

Q: Where do I renew my driver's license or vehicle registration?
A: Driver's licenses, vehicle registrations, and titles are handled by the  Kansas  Department of Revenue (DOR), not the Kansas Department of Transportation. Please visit a local DOR license office or their official website for assistance with licensing and vehicle services.

Q: How do I report a pothole or a broken sign?
A: You can report road maintenance issues directly to me. Please provide a clear description and specific location of the problem. Alternatively, you can report issues through the MoDOT website's "Report a Road Concern" page or by calling our 24/7 customer service line.

Q: What should I do if my car breaks down on the highway?
A: If your vehicle breaks down, your safety is the top priority. Pull over to the right shoulder as far as possible, turn on your emergency flashers, and stay inside your vehicle with your seatbelt on. If you must exit, do so on the side away from traffic. For assistance on a major highway, you can call *55 to reach the   State Highway Patrol.

Q: What are the rules for driving through a work zone?
A: When approaching a work zone, please slow down, stay alert, and eliminate distractions.   law requires you to obey all posted signs and flaggers. Fines for speeding are significantly higher in work zones to protect our crews. Remember our motto: "Buckle Up, Phone Down." ðŸ’¡

Q: Do I need to pay tolls on   highways?
A: The vast majority of  's highways, including major interstates like I-70 and I-44, are not tolled. Some specific major bridges or newly constructed express lanes may have tolls, but these will always be clearly marked with signage well in advance.

Q: How does the Adopt-A-Highway program work?
A: The Adopt-A-Highway program is a wonderful community initiative where volunteer groups can help keep our roadsides clean. Groups "adopt" a two-mile stretch of highway and agree to pick up litter at least four times a year. In return, MoDOT provides safety training, trash bags, and a sign recognizing the group's contribution. More information and applications are available on the website. ðŸŒ±
